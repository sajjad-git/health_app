This repository contains one of my 3rd year projects that is still in the development process. Currently, the repository contains some parts of the front-end.
In the coming 2 weeks the front-end and the back-end will be completer, integrated, and uploaded to this repository.

In this project I have incorporated SDLC testing concepts, methodologies and metrics in the management and development process.
I have also Incorporated object-oriented design principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance to ensure minimal code redundancy, and to enhance code quality, clarity, and readability.
The backend is designed an optimized with Java, SQL, and Apache Tomcat, and the database is contained in MS Access.
